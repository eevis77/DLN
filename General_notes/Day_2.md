#Day 2

Today the prof came by and advised me that there is no more grant money left for congress travel.
Decided to apply for MH Foundation grant for conference travel.
Started on application with assistance from Dr Green.

The protocol for my next experiment is now created. 
It will be documented [here](/methods/bcftools_protocol.md).
